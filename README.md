# drivers-licence-budget
Very simple little scipt to keep track of my expenses for my dirvers licence.
To use i simply run the python file, enter the amount I payed and the program takes 
care of the rest. It recognized what type of expense it was and which date it was made. 
When done calculating everything, it adds the new data to the JSON file which keeps track of
the remaining budget as well as the different purchased. It also writes data into the txt
file which makes it easier to get an overview. 

## Update 4 march 2021
Added one more alternative for what can be purchased and sensed as an item. Before, paying 325
would have resulted in an "Other expense". I have also added the date do be one of the things recorded
as data about the purchase
